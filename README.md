# MotivateMe

Android app designed to let users input tasks or goals that they'd like to achieve. This earns the user points that they can use to "roll a die" for rewards.

This app was designed with the idea of helping people better themselves or to help convince them to work towards certain goals.

I have found that it's especially useful for neurodivergent people like me with ADHD or some other sort of motivational issue.
